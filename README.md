# CHIMERA
CHIMERA is a Streamlit (Python) based application that allows scaling and standardization of concept set creation and mapping.

The application features a user-friendly interface that allows users to upload input files with source (non-standard) and/or standard clinical codes, it maps the source codes to their corresponding standards, and uses WebAPI to generate multiple concepts sets in ATLAS with appropriate naming conventions. It effectively manages the inclusion and exclusion of codes and their descendants. The application includes both the source code and its corresponding standard code in the concept set and generates a table with the source and mapped codes and corresponding concept names.
